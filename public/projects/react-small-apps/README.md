# React Small Apps

A collection of small apps implemented with ReactJS.

## Description

I want to keep track of some small apps but I don't want to pollute my Github space with multiple repositories. So, I decided to gather them inside an unique repo.

## Preview

You can see a live preview of each app here: https://demo.armandphilippot.com/
